## Abstract
This specification defines a standardized way of creating stealth addresses for smart contract wallets. This ERC enables senders of transactions/transfers to generate private stealth addresses for their recipients that only the recpient can eventually unlock. 

## Motivation
The standardization of stealth address generation may unlock significant privacy-potential within Smart Contract Wallets, allowing the recipient of a transfer to remain private when recieving an asset. A Stealth address is generated by the sender from a shared secret between sender and recipient and can only be unlocked by recipient, because only the recipient can compute the matching private key. 
Observers have no possibility linking the recipient's stealth address to the recipients identity, leaving only the sender with that information.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every `ERC-N` compliant smart contract wallet MUST implement the `ERC165` (`0x01ffc9a7`) interface.

Stealth Address Generation
    

```
 Sender Keypair    --> (s,S) | S = s * G // s represents a sender-generated secret
 Recipient Keypair --> (p,P) | P = p * G
 
    
 For transfering:
    sharedSecret    = s*P
    stealthAddress  = pubtoaddr(P + (G * keccak(sharedSecret))) # // ``to`` value
    publishableData = G * s = S                                   // ``publishableData`` value

    
 For receiving:
    forall publishableData `S` do:
        if pubtoaddr(P + (G * keccak(S * p))) has token:
            store_key(p + keccak(S * p))
    
```


## Rationale
`EIP-N` emerged from the need of having privacy-preserving ways to transfer ownership without revealing the recipient's identity. Tokens can reveal sensitive private information about the owner. While users might want to prove the ownership of a NFT-concert ticket, they might not want to reveal personal account-related information at the same time. The standardization of stealth address generation represents a significant step for privacy. Privacy-preserving solutions require standards to gain adoption, therefore it is critical to focus on generalisable ways of implementing related solutions.
    
This extension standardizes the method to create and look-up Stealth Addresses. Users can send assets without having to interact with the recipient before. Stealth addresses allow only the recipients of token transfers to see that they were the recipients. 
    

## Backwards Compatibility
EIP--- is fully backwards compatibly with basic `ERC-721` contracts. `EIP---` implements the [`EIP-165`](./eip-165.md) standard.

## Reference Implementation
You can find an implementation of this standard in  [./eip.sol](./eip.sol).

## Security Considerations
TBD
